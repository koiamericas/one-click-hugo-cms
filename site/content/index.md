    For the past few weeks, the PRTC has been collaborating with government
    agencies and the private sector to provide immediate relief while ensuring
    the safety of all visitors and residents. The support received to date has
    been remarkable and we continue to welcome relief efforts from partners who
    are interested in helping the people of Puerto Rico as we focus on
    rebuilding our Island
  paragraph: >-
    Recent advancements on major tourism infrastructure, like our main airport
    fully operational with back to normal schedules and operational cruise ports
    and hotels, show a steady pace on our rebuilding path. Assessment continues
    as we have been in constant communication with our tourism partners across
    the Island. We are glad to report that the preparedness measures put into
    place have allowed for what we are expecting to be a full recovery for our
    tourism industry. We look forward to getting back on our feet in the hopes
    of welcoming visitors to the Island in the weeks ahead. We are confident
    that with the continuous support of our industry partners, we can build a
    stronger Puerto Rico
