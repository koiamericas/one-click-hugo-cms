            “For the past few weeks, the PRTC has been collaborating with government agencies and the private sector to provide immediate relief while ensuring the safety of all visitors and residents. The support received to date has been remarkable and we continue to welcome relief efforts from partners who are interested in helping the people of Puerto Rico as we focus on rebuilding our Island.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recent advancements on major tourism infrastructure, like our main airport fully operational with back to normal schedules and operational cruise ports and hotels, show a steady pace on our rebuilding path. Assessment continues as we have been in constant communication with our tourism partners across the Island. We are glad to report that the preparedness measures put into place have allowed for what we are expecting to be a full recovery for our tourism industry. We look forward to getting back on our feet in the hopes of welcoming visitors to the Island in the weeks ahead. We are confident that with the continuous support of our industry partners, we can build a stronger Puerto Rico.”
